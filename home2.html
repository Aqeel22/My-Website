    <p> 
    My goal is to be a Technical Project Management in an environment where my skills as a leader, communicator and facilitator, help empower team members to excel in their roles. Value will be added not only to my team, but to the overall company by establishing a presence of patience, positivity, and humility. To be in an environment where core values are emphasized and enforced, would be an honor. As a technical project manager I will bring results to companies by showing a passion to learn, facilitate and motivate others."
